# ComputorV1 & ComputorV2
42 2019 - Algorithmic project

### What is ComputorV1

ComputorV1 is on the first project post cirlce of the algorithmic branch in 42 Paris.

The goal of the project is to create a program which will resolve equation simple equation (polynomial equation degree 2 <= )

### What is ComputorV2

ComputorV2 is the project after ComputorV1, in this project, you are expected to create your own calculator in command line. But you'll also have to implement matricial calcul, function solver, calcul on imaginary numbers...

## Running the tests

My project mark is : 
Computorv1 : Not Pushed Yet
Computorv2 : Not Pushed Yet

If you want to test our project, you just have to build then

```
python run.py
```

And everything will be in the command line :)
